Global Chem is an open-source graph database and api for common and rare chemical lists using IUPAC as input and SMILES/SMARTS as output. As 
mostly needed by myself as I search through chemical infinity.

We have useful tools that we use to analyze chemical data starting with functional groups. Please navigate to the documentation
for more details or the original GlobalChem page.

Installation 
============

GlobalChemExtensions is going to be distribute via PyPi and as the content store grows we can expand it to other pieces of software
making it accessible to all regardless of what you use. Alternatively, you could have a glance at the source code and copy/paste
it yourself.

```

pip install global-chem-extensions

```
